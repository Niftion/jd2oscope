## Project Status

- `3dmodels/`: Iteration 1 complete; iteration 2 WIP
  - Considering different potentiometer & button models
- `firmware/`: Iteration 1 WIP
- `hardware/`: Iteration 1 complete; iteration 2 WIP
  - Adjustments needed to account for pullups/pulldowns & tri-state buffer
  - Considering swapping potentiometers for rotary encoders & using different buttons
  - Potentially re-evaluate netclasses/copper trace thicknesses
  - flip around opAmp (for some reason was inverted in schematics)
  - ensure all passives' values *actually exist* (if not, modify circuit to use ones that do)
