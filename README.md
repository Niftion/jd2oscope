## Project Status

- `3dmodels/`: Mostly complete
  - Considering different potentiometer & button models
- `firmware/`: WIP
- `hardware/`: Mostly complete
  - Adjustments needed to account for pullups/pulldowns & tri-state buffer
  - Considering swapping potentiometers for rotary encoders & using different buttons
  - Potentially re-evaluate netclasses/copper trace thicknesses
  - flip around opAmp (for some reason was inverted in schematics)
